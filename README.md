The main objective of this project is to find out the way to bruteforce directories and subdomains of a web application recursively by giving our own custom wordlist.
This tool can perform both task simultaneously with different wordlist given at the same time.

Usage :- 

crawly.py --url //addurl --wordlist //add wordlist path
